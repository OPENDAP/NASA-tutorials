There are serious problems with the netcdf-c library version 4.9.1 and
4.9.2 that have broken EDL authentication. 4.9.0 does work, but trying
to use that with a conda env was just too hard. 

I switched to the python venv system and installed packages using pip
which, via stroke of good fortune, worked.

I added pip-tools so that requirements.in --> requirements.txt works.
This should streamline running the notebooks using binder.

Pulled this out of the larger collection of notebooks to focus on this
jst about NASA's data and OPeNDAP servers.
