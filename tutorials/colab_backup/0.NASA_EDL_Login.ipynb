    "To read data from NASA's OPeNDAP servers, you first need to do three (simple) things:\n",
    "* Login to Earthdata Login using your username and password\n",
    "* Make a special configuration file (named _~/.dodsrc_) with one important line\n",
    "* And, for access to data in the NASA cloud system, Approve the _Hyrax in the Cloud_ application\n",
    "\n",
    "The following three cells will do those steps (mostly) for you. To start, you need an Earthdata Login\n",
    "username and password. If you already have a login, even if you got that for use with other services - \n",
    "one username and password works for all of the NASA services. If you don't have them, go to\n",
    "__[Earthdata Login](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/eosdis/science-system-description/eosdis-components/earthdata-login)__\n",
