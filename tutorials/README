There are serious problems with the netcdf-c library version 4.9.1 and
4.9.2 that have broken EDL authentication. 4.9.0 does work, but trying
to use that with a conda env was just too hard. 

I switched to the python venv system and installed packages using pip
which, via stroke of good fortune, worked. Setup goes like this:

	python3 -m venv myenv	# make the virtual env
	source myenv/bin/activate	# use it in the current shell

Then install packages. The good fortune comes from pip now using
netcdf-c 4.9.3-development for the netCDF4 python package. EDL
authentication works with that version and there is no incompatibility
issue with otehr packages.

	pip install netCDF4
	pip install matplotlib cartopy numpy jupyter earthaccess

This gets an env that enables the plain netcdf notebook.

For the xarray/netcdf notebook, add

	pip install xarray

I added pip-tools so that requirements.in --> requirements.txt works.
This should streamline running the notebooks using binder.
